Easily use `@frigobar/animation` animation hooks through an `animation` prop.

Just add the animation prop directly on the component with the desired
animation to apply it.

```jsx
function App() {
  const [{ animation }] = useFade({ duration: 1000 });

  return <div animation={animation}>Fade animation</div>;
}
```
